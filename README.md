# odin-landing-page

This is my attempt at the landing page assignment for The Odin Project.

I'll consider this completed. I definitely took some liberties with this project but overall I'm very happy with what I've accomplished in the time that I've spent on this. Compared to the last time I had attempted this, this was an incredibly smoother process. I definitely feel more confident with using flexbox and styling pages with CSS, but I know there's a lot more I can learn.

I'll return to this at some point to tidy it up, add some more text and images to replace the placeholders, and ultimately bring it a little bit closer to the image provided as per the assignment.
